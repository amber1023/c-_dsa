/*First, sort the array, and run a nested loop, fix an index, and then try to fix an upper and lower 
index within which we can use all the lengths to form a triangle with that fixed index.


1.Sort the array and then take three variables l, r, and i, pointing to start, end-1,
and array element starting from the end of the array.

2.Traverse the array from the end (n-1 to 1), and for each iteration keep the value of l = 0 and r = i-1
3.Now if a triangle can be formed using arr[l] and arr[r] then triangles can obviously be formed
from a[l+1], a[l+2]â€¦..a[r-1], arr[r] and a[i], because the array is sorted , 
which can be directly calculated using (r-l). and then decrement the value of r and continue the loop till l is less than r
4. If a triangle cannot be formed using arr[l] and arr[r] then increment the value of l and continue the loop till l is less than r 
So the overall complexity of iterating 
through all array elements reduces
